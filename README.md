[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

---------- Stage 1 ----------

-Sorting-

[22,27,16,2,18,6]
[2,27,16,22,18,6]
[2,6,16,22,18,27]
[2,6,16,18,22,27]

---------- Stage 2 ----------

As Big-O -->  O(n^2)  

---------- Stage 3 ----------

-Time Complexity-

If the number we are looking for is in the start BEST CASE      
If the number we are looking for is in the middle AVERAGE CASE  <<<---------       
If the number we are looking for is in the end WORST CASE                   |
                                                                            |
We are looking for '18' ----------------------------------------------------

---------- Stage 4 ----------

-First 4 step of sorting --> [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] -

*Step 1 : [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
*Step 2 : [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
*Step 3 : [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
*Step 4 : [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
